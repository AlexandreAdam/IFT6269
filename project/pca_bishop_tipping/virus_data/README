Datasets for `Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks' by B.D. Ripley
=====================================================================

Cambridge University Press (1996)  ISBN  0-521-46086-7

The background to the datasets is described in section 1.4; this file
relates the computer-readable files to that description.



Cushing's syndrome
------------------

Data from Aitchison & Dunsmore (1975, Tables 11.1-3).

Data file Cushings.dat has four columns, 

Label of the patient
Tetrhydrocortisone  (mg/24hr)
Pregnanetriol  (mg/24hr)
Type

The type of the last six patients (u1 to u6) should be
regarded as unknown.  (The code `o' indicates `other').



synthetic two-class problem
---------------------------

Data from Ripley (1994a).

This has two real-valued co-ordinates (xs and ys) and a class (xc)
which is 0 or 1.

Data file  synth.tr   has 250 rows of the training set
           synth.te   has 1000 rows of the test set  (not used here)



viruses
-------

This is a dataset on 61 viruses with rod-shaped particles affecting
various crops (tobacco, tomato, cucumber and others) described by
{Fauquet et al. (1988) and analysed by Eslava-G\'omez (1989).  There
are 18 measurements on each virus,  the number of amino acid residues
per molecule of coat protein.

Data file  viruses.dat  has 61 rows of 18 counts
	   virus3.dat   has 38 rows corresponding to the distinct
	   		Tobamoviruses.

The whole dataset is in order Hordeviruses (3), Tobraviruses (6),
Tobamoviruses (39) and `furoviruses' (13).



Leptograpsus crabs
------------------

Data from Campbell & Mahon (1974) on the morphology of rock crabs of
genus Leptograpsus.

There are 50 specimens of each sex of each of two colour forms.

Data file  crabs.dat has rows

sp	`species', coded B (blue form) or O (orange form)
sex	coded M or F
index	within each group of 50
FL	frontal lip of carapace (mm)
RW	rear width of carapace (mm)
CL	length along the midline of carapace (mm)
CW	maximum width of carapace (mm)
BD	body depth (mm)



Forensic glass
--------------

This example comes from forensic testing of glass collected by
B. German on 214 fragments of glass.  It is also contained in the
UCI machine-learning database collection (Murphy & Aha, 1995).

Data file fglass.dat has 214 rows with data for a single glass
fragment.

RI	refractive index
Na	% weight of sodium oxide(s)
Mg	% weight of magnesium oxide(s)
Al	% weight of aluminium oxide(s)
Si	% weight of silicon oxide(s)
K	% weight of potassium oxide(s)
Ca	% weight of calcium oxide(s)
Ba	% weight of barium oxide(s)
Fe	% weight of iron oxide(s)
type	coded 1 to 7

The type codes are:

	1 (WinF) window float glass
	2 (WinNF) window non-float glass
	3 (Veh) vehicle glass
	5 (Con)  containers
	6 (Tabl) tableware
	7 (Head) vehicle headlamp glass

The ten groups used for the cross-validation experiments (I believe)
are listed as row numbers in the file fglass.grp,



Diabetes in Pima Indians
------------------------

A population of women who were at least 21 years old, of Pima Indian heritage
and living near Phoenix, Arizona,  was tested for diabetes
according to World Health Organization criteria.  The data
were collected by the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases (Smith et al, 1988). This example is also contained in the
UCI machine-learning database collection (Murphy & Aha, 1995).

The data files have rows containing

npreg 	number of pregnancies
glu 	plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test
bp 	diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
skin 	triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
ins	serum insulin (micro U/ml)
bmi 	body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
ped 	diabetes pedigree function
age 	in years
type	No / Yes

Data file pima.tr   has 200 rows of complete training data.
          pima.te   has 332 rows of complete test data.
          pima.tr2  has the 200 rows of pima.tr plus 100 incomplete rows.
